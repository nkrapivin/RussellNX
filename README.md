A tool to build Nintendo Switch homebrew games using GameMaker Studio 2's runtime.

If you have no idea how to use `switch_` GMS 2 functions, feel free to visit the [RussellNX Wiki.](https://github.com/nkrapivin/RussellNX/wiki) (no NDA or devkit required)

Please don't ask for `prod.keys` file, you must dump it yourself from your own Switch. Oh, and make sure you dump it via "Lockpick-RCM" and not the regular "Lockpick".

List of ported games (no links just in case):

- Chip and Dale: Rescue Rangers Remastered

- AM2R (Lojical's a pussy btw)

- Pingo

- ??? (want your own game to be here? feel free to contact me.)
